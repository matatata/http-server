# http-server
When I was studying computer science at TU-Darmstadt there was this assignment to implement a http-server that proxies requests and caches responses (maybe in 2003 or 2004). In the same year I took the http-parts and turned it into a simple http-server with no caching functionality. Over a decade later I now put this to github.
